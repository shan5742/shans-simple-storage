# shans-simple-storage

A simple smart contract that simply has a variable that can be retrieved and updated. The contract also keeps track of how many times the variable - in this case a message - has been updated as well as how many individual accounts have updated the message.

It's simple enough to use. Once you connect your wallet you can choose to get the current message from the contract or set your own, assuming you have the gas fees to cover the transaction.
